    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides **GraphRAG QA** functionality that extracts knowledge from PDF documents and enables natural language queries through a **Neo4j graph database**. After users upload PDF documents, they are processed using **OpenAI's GPT models** (e.g., `gpt-4o` and `text-ada-002`) to extract entities and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted information is stored in a **Neo4j graph database**. Users can then interact with the graph in real-time by asking natural language questions, which are converted into **Cypher queries** to retrieve answers from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time GraphRAG:** Enables real-time knowledge extraction from documents and supports interactive querying.\n",
    "- **Modular and Configurable:** Users can set up their own credentials for `OpenAI` and `Neo4j`.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Interface:** Ask questions in plain English and get answers from the graph database.\n",

    "Here's how to create a powerful question-answering chain using the `GraphCypherQAChain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a custom prompt template that helps generate Cypher queries. This template is quite comprehensive - it includes all the available relationship types in our database like `MENTIONS`, `PERFORMS`, `USES_POWER`, `HAS_STATUS`, `OPERATES_ON`, and `REQUIRES`. It also provides an example query structure to ensure proper formatting and includes a placeholder where we'll insert the user's question.\n",

    "- We use our configured `llm` for query generation\n",
    "- We connect it to our `graph` database\n",
    "- We incorporate our `cypher_prompt` template\n",
    "- We enable `verbose` mode for detailed logging\n",
    "- We set `return_intermediate_steps` to see what's happening under the hood\n",
    "- We set `allow_dangerous_requests` to true for handling complex queries\n",
    "- We limit our results to the top 3 matches with `top_k`\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole setup creates a **powerful chain** that can take **natural language questions** from users, convert them into **proper Cypher queries**, and fetch relevant answers from our graph database.

    "## Define QA Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how this function combines a **graph database query** with an **LLM fallback** to provide answers efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it searches the graph database using a `Cypher query`. It looks for `Document` nodes connected via `MENTIONS` relationships that contain the question's keyword in their text. This is the primary way the function tries to find answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first query doesn't return a result, it splits the question into individual words and searches using each word as a keyword. This approach helps when a single keyword doesn't match exactly but parts of the question might.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function includes several fallback mechanisms:\n",
    "- If no answer is found in the database, the question is passed to an `LLM`\n",
    "- The `LLM` processes the query and generates an answer independently\n",
    "- The entire process is wrapped in a try-except block for smooth error handling\n",
    "- Users receive friendly error messages if something goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "The function follows a clear decision path:\n",
    "- Return database answer if found\n",
    "- Use LLM's answer if database search fails\n",
    "- Ask user to rephrase if both methods fail\n",
    "\n",
    "This **hybrid approach** ensures flexibility, combining the speed of database queries with the depth of LLM-generated answers. It's perfect for handling both structured and unstructured data queries seamlessly."
